title: Hello, World!

This is my first blog post, and in it I'd like to share my journey to becoming a software developer along with a road map to getting started in the field.

### Career Road Map

I'll start off by providing the series of steps I would recommend to those getting started with programming and software development. But before you take a look, you should **determine your goals** – e.g., do I want to be a front-end or back-end web developer? Am I interested in machine learning? Am I just a hobbyist? The answer to these questions should shape your studies; however, there are fundamentals that are common to all career paths in software, so I'll focus mainly on those.

1. **Learn the fundamentals of programming.** You already have a good grasp of what you can do with computers, now you need to learn how to leverage their power by writing programs. Read [*Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C-ebook/dp/B00KPTEH8C/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534189511&sr=1-2&keywords=programming+principles+and+practice+using+c%2B%2B) by Bjarne Stroustrup and do exercises from every section and chapter. Learn about objects, types, values, functions, etc.

2. **Learn data structures and algorithms.** Make sure you've got step 1 down, then move on to obtaining the knowledge that many employers look for when screening interviewees – knowing which data structure is the best choice for the given problem and how to prove your answer in terms of space and time complexity. The text by T. Cormen et al., [*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=zg_bs_132570011_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=PE38KXR7RQ01E0PYKY0R#reader_0262033844), is consistently held as a top contender. You need to know what lists, stacks, heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, and AVL trees are, just to name a few; you need to be able to identify which data structure is the most ideal (i.e., most efficient and easiest to implement) for a given problem specification; and you need to know how to determine the time and space complexities for various algorithms, including those of the recursive type. Make sure you understand what Big-Oh, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega mean. Also learn dynamic programming, memoization, and sorting algorithms – insertion, merge, selection sort, and so on.

3. **Complete David Malan's MOOC, CS 75: Building Dynamic Websites.** I know this step doesn't sound like a software engineering fundamental, but it really should be. In it you will learn about HTTP, DNS, databases, the LAMP stack, UI design, XML, front-end frameworks, and more. In my limited knowledge, I don't see how one could be a successful software developer without some experience in the material covered in this course. Watch the lectures, complete the three projects, you won't be disappointed.

4. **Build something.** It's very important to put the knowledge you learn into practice by building something you can share with others. Over the course of my learning I've built a few projects and put them on a GitHub account. By building something you're interested in, you not only gain more experience beyond the academics, but you also grow crucial motivation in seeing how relevant those fundamentals you've been studying actually are. Some folks might argue that this step is more important than the rest.

5. **(Optional) Use a Linux OS.** I recommend using Linux Ubuntu or Mint as your operating system simply because it will make you a more savvy user... a superuser. Doing so, you will gain better understanding of using software packages, making software packages, using the command line, firmware, and more. Developing software on Linux does require a bit of effort to keep things running smoothly, but at the same time you will benefit from an OS that fosters an efficient workflow and versatility. (I highly recommend reading my post [*Linux Won't Boot*](https://johnns620.github.io/2018/07/07/Linux-Won't-Boot.html) for a taste of the potential issues.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will just stress that steps 1 and 2 are most important to software engineering. You must know these fundamentals to be able to write efficient code and be sure that it is in fact efficient and scalable. Anyone interested in becoming a software engineer should get a copy of [*Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) by G. L. McDowell. It's easy to get lost in studying and forget that one day you will be standing in front of a white board being asked to delete a node from a binary search tree or reverse a list using recursion, so reading through a book like this will help with keeping perspective. Now I will share how my journey to becoming a software engineer has unfolded.

### My Coding Story

I took my first programming class during the summer of 2011 at the end my sophomore year in college. The language used in the course was C++, a powerful and widely-used language that I would recommend every beginning programmer start with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Again, I recommend Bjarne Stroustrup’s [*Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C-ebook/dp/B00KPTEH8C/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534189511&sr=1-2&keywords=programming+principles+and+practice+using+c%2B%2B) as a first text. He did create the language, after all. ಠ‿↼**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my junior and senior years, I made use of Fortran, C++, and mostly Matlab for solving problems in my engineering courses, but during this time my programs were fairly simple and did not make use of object-oriented programming, data structures, or algorithm analysis. It wasn't until after the university, when I began working with robotics, automation, and data acquisition systems, that I became interested in learning more about software engineering.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**It’s clich\'e, but I began to understand how much can be done and what can be reached by leveraging the power of computers.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too soon into my new role as a recent grad, I also started to become aware of how data analysis, data science, and software engineering are intertwined. In 2014 I started learning to write SQL queries, and I also began to read [*Building Java Programs*](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Java-Programs-Stuart-Reges/dp/0133360903) by S. Reges and M. Stepp. The same year I also began studying mathematical proof writing, set theory, symbolic logic, discrete math; my main reference was the text by Douglas Smith, [*A Transition to Advanced Mathematics*](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_16?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=transition+to+advanced+mathematics&sprefix=transition+to+ad%2Cstripbooks%2C153&crid=1VIAAVU9XCXNO). I was getting myself prepared for work in numerical analysis and data science.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall of 2015 I took my first numerical analysis course with [Dr. Moody Chu](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/mtchu/) at NC State University and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I wasn't studying math, I was brushing up on C++ with a borrowed copy of Stroustrup's text and continuing through *Building Java Programs*. In January of 2016 I began taking an abstract algebra course and a real analysis course at NC State to prepare for graduate study in applied mathematics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**I knew that if I became knowledgeable of applied math, I would have the background necessary to solve problems in physical modeling, high-performance computing, and data science, three of my biggest interests.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year I moved on from the introductory programming to studying data structures and algorithms; my main reference was [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338) by M. Goodrich et al.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2016, the site where I worked was shut down. (You can read about that [here](https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/techflash/2015/10/monsanto-to-close-research-triangle-park-rd-site.html).) I think that in general a layoff is bad, but for me it provided the opportunity to run full-steam ahead into learning about software development. The very first thing I did after the layoff was to build my computer (a solid machine if I do say so myself) and start learning web development. At this stage of my journey, I was learning web development and data structures while working on an application to the graduate school at the University of Washington-Seattle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 2016, I started by working through David Malan's MOOC [Building Dynamic Websites](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/), learning HTTP, PHP, XML, JavaScript, SQL, and the MVC design pattern. (This course is a must in my opinion.) I also began development on my RESTful API [jMessage](https://github.com/JohnSell620/jMessage), starting with Koushik Kothagal's tutorial on YouTube, [Developing RESTful APIs with JAX-RS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkKcdK1u95s&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZh5U8RbdXq0WaYvZBz2rbn). My personal website was another project that I began working on around this time. I learned build tools like Gulp, Bower, Webpack, the front-end framework jQuery, responsive design, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, and so on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Almost two years have passed and I'm still updating and working on my personal website regularly.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of 2017 I began my master's degree program at UW-Seattle. My first class was AMATH 583: High-Performance Scientific Computing. Up to this point it has been my favorite class of all time. I started developing my [HPC-Library](https://github.com/JohnSell620/HPC-Library) during the course, and after the semester I started working on a C++ desktop application called [NumInt](https://github.com/JohnSell620/NumInt) which tests HPC-Library and also evaluates triple integrals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In Summer of 2017 I also began my journey down the road of machine learning. I plan to blog on that fantastic voyage at a later date.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my first data science project, I decided to scrape book reviews from the Goodreads website (yes, even though they have an API) to do sentiment classification on them, basically to get an idea of how representative the rating of each book was of the true average sentiment of the people that wrote reviews. The repository for that project is [here](https://github.com/JohnSell620/sentiment-analysis-goodreads-reviews). I began learning Python in the beginning of 2017 by working through the [Python challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) – no, I have not finished it. In my case, this challenge along with machine learning projects have been the best means for learning this language.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**This brings me to the best advice I can offer someone just starting out; it's a very obvious, common-sense notion, but for anyone like me, this advice can sort of fly under the radar: the best way to learn programming is to jump on projects that interest you and not stop working on them until they're completed.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of my career, I have over two years of solid programming experience, I've made contributions to open source software ([NodePy](https://github.com/ketch/nodepy) and [Google Earth Enterprise](https://github.com/google/earthenterprise)), I'm still completing my master's degree, and I'm ready to start my first official role as a software engineer. I'm looking for an innovative, dynamic company where I can work on things that are interesting and challenging and where I can become a great developer, engineer, researcher, and person. I'll be back here soon with updates on how things are going. In the mean time, keep coding!
