title: Hello, World!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first blog post, and in it I'd like to share my journey to becoming a software developer. Hopefully my story will be useful and inspiring for others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took my first programming class during the summer of 2011 at the end my sophomore year in college. The language was C++ -- the best choice for new learners, in my opinion. The language was C++ – the best choice for new learners, in my opinion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In fact, I recommend reading Bjarne Stroustrup’s text, [*The C++ Programming Language*](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840), as a first text. He did create the language, after all.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my junior and senior years, I made use of Fortran, C++, and mostly Matlab for solving problems in my engineering courses, but during this time, my programs were fairly simple and did not make use of object-oriented programming, data structures, or algorithm analysis. It wasn't until after the university, when I began working with robotics, automation, and data acquisition systems with a data-driven company, that I became interested in learning more about software engineering.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**It’s cliche`, but I began to understand how much can be done and what can be reached by leveraging the power of computers.** (I truly believe more professionals should learn programming, no matter what profession they’re in. Not only will it improve your ability to solve problems, but you’re learning to wield one of the most powerful tools.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too soon into my new role as a recent grad, I also started to become aware of how data analysis, data science, and software engineering are intertwined. In 2014 I started learning to write SQL queries, and I also began to read [*Building Java Programs*](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Java-Programs-Stuart-Reges/dp/0133360903) by S. Reges and M. Stepp. The same year I also began studying mathematical proof writing, set theory, symbolic logic, discrete math; my main reference was the text by Douglas Smith, [*A Transition to Advanced Mathematics*](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_16?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=transition+to+advanced+mathematics&sprefix=transition+to+ad%2Cstripbooks%2C153&crid=1VIAAVU9XCXNO). I was getting prepared for work in numerical analysis and data science.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall of 2015 I took my first numerical analysis course with [Dr. Moody Chu](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/mtchu/) at NC State University and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I wasn't studying math, I was brushing up on C++ with a borrowed copy of Stroustrup's text and continuing through Reges et al's text. In January of 2016 I began taking an abstract algebra course and a real analysis course at NC State to prepare for graduate study in applied mathematics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**I knew that if I became knowledgeable of applied math, I would have the background necessary to solve problems in physical modeling and data science, two of my main interests.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year I moved on from the introductory programming texts to studying data structures and algorithms. My main reference was [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338) by M. Goodrich et al.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2016, the site where I worked was shut down. You can read about that [here](https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/techflash/2015/10/monsanto-to-close-research-triangle-park-rd-site.html). I think in general a layoff is bad, but for me it provided the opportunity to run full-steam ahead into software development. The very first thing I did was build my computer (a solid machine if I do say so myself), dual booting with Windows 10 and Linux Mint 18 Sarah.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**At this stage of my journey, I was learning web development and data structures while working on an application to the graduate school at the University of Washington-Seattle.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fall of 2016, I started by going through David Malan's MOOC [Building Dynamic Websites](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/), learning HTTP, PHP, XML, JavaScript, SQL, MVC. (This course is a must in my opinion.) I also began development on my RESTful API [jMessage](https://github.com/JohnSell620/jMessage), starting with Koushik Kothagal's tutorial on YouTube, [Developing RESTful APIs with JAX-RS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkKcdK1u95s&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZh5U8RbdXq0WaYvZBz2rbn). By this time I was getting thoroughly introduced to web development across the full stack. My personal website was one of my very fist projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on my personal website has provided a decent portion of the web-dev knowledge that I have. I worked with build tools like Gulp, Bower, Webpack, and the front-end framework jQuery. I've learned responsive design, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, and so on. (Thank you Google and StackOverflow.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Almost two years have passed and I'm still updating and working on my personal website regularly.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spring of 2017 I began my master's degree program at UW-Seattle. My first class was AMATH 583: High-Performance Scientific Computing. Up to this point in time it has been my favorite class of all time. I started developing my [HPC-Library](https://github.com/JohnSell620/HPC-Library) during the course, and after the semester I started working on a C++ desktop application using Qt Creator, [NumInt](https://github.com/JohnSell620/NumInt), which tests HPC-Library and also evaluates triple integrals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In Summer of 2017 I also began my journey down the road of machine learning.As one might expect, it's very exciting, and I plan to blog on that voyage at a later date.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my first data science project, I decided to scrape book reviews from the Goodreads website (\*sighs\* even though they have an API) and do a sentiment classification on them basically to get an idea of how representative the rating of each book was of the true average sentiment of the people that wrote reviews. The repository for that project is [here](https://github.com/JohnSell620/sentiment-analysis-goodreads-reviews). I started learning Python in the beginning of 2017 with the [Python challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), but it wasn't until I started with machine learning projects that my Python skills jumped to an advanced level.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And this illustrates one of the most obvious, common-sense notions about programming that any good mentor will express that yet is not so quickly grasped (at least for me): the best way to learn programming is to jump on projects that interest you and don't stop working on them until they're completed.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of my career, I have over two years of solid programming experience, I've made contributions to open source software ([NodePy](https://github.com/ketch/nodepy) and [Google Earth Enterprise](https://github.com/google/earthenterprise)), I'm still completing my master's degree, and I'm ready to start my first "official" role as a software engineer. I'm looking for an innovative, dynamic company where I can work on things that are interesting and challenging and where I can advance my career. I'll be back here soon with updates on how things are going. In the mean time, keep coding!
