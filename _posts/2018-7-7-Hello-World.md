title: Hello, World!
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first blog post, and I'd like to share with everyone my journey to becoming a software developer. This is a significant aspect of my life, and my story may be useful or inspiring to others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first programming class was during the summer of 2011 after finishing my sophomore year, and the language was C++. My junior and senior years were peppered with Fortran, Matlab, and C++ programming, mostly solving engineering problems -- nothing as sophisticated as OOP. After graduating, the software scope shifted to SCARA (selective compliance assembly robot arm) and CNC lathe programming, but it wasn't until I started working in an automated greenhouse and data acquisition site that I began to really see first hand computing power in practice; before this, computing was always sort of vague and theoretical.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work was my catalyst for realizing that I wanted a career where the work entailed leveraging the power of computation to model and understand the world. In 2014 I read [*Building Java Programs*](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Java-Programs-Stuart-Reges/dp/0133360903) by S. Reges and M. Stepp. The same year I also began studying mathematical proof writing, set theory, symbolic logic, discrete math; my main reference was the text by Douglas Smith, [*A Transition to Advanced Mathematics*](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_16?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=transition+to+advanced+mathematics&sprefix=transition+to+ad%2Cstripbooks%2C153&crid=1VIAAVU9XCXNO). I was getting prepared for work in numerical analysis and data science -- my greatest interests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015 I took my first numerical analysis course with Dr. Moody Chu at NC State University and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I wasn't studying math, I was brushing up on C++ again with a textbook I borrowed from a coworker. In January of 2016 I began taking an abstract algebra (mind warp) course and a real analysis course at NC State, because by this time, I knew I wanted to go to graduate school for applied mathematics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that if I became knowledgeable of applied math, I would have the background necessary to be successful with the problems in physical modeling and data science. That year I moved on from the introductory programming texts to studying data structures and algorithms. My main reference was [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338) by M. Goodrich et al.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2016, the site where I worked was shut down. For me, this was perfect timing to run full-steam ahead at software development. The very first thing I did was build my computer -- a solid machine if I do say so myself. I chose to dual boot with Windows 10 and Linux Mint 18 Sarah. Using a Linux OS will get you from casual to super user fairly quickly in my experience. After getting up and running, I started doing lots of web development while still studying data structures (and applying for grad school and the University of Washington-Seattle).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started by going through David Malan's MOOC [Building Dynamic Websites](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/), learning HTTP, PHP, XML, JavaScript, SQL, MVC. It was a great course. I also began development on my RESTful API [jMessage](https://github.com/JohnSell620/jMessage) starting with Koushik Kothagal's tutorial on YouTube, Developing [RESTful APIs with JAX-RS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkKcdK1u95s&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZh5U8RbdXq0WaYvZBz2rbn). By fall of 2016 I was getting thoroughly introduced to web development across the full stack. I began working on my personal website as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on my personal website has provided a large portion of the web-dev knowledge I have now. I worked with build tools like Gulp, Bower, Webpack, and the front-end framework jQuery; I've learned responsive design, HTML5 aspects, Sass, CSS3, and so on. I have come to appreciate the contributors to StackOverflow very much. Almost two years have passed and I'm still updating and working on my personal website regularly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spring of 2017 I started my master's degree program a UW-Seattle. My first class was AMATH 583: High-Performance Scientific Computing. So far it has been my favorite class of all time. I started developing my [HPC-Library](https://github.com/JohnSell620/HPC-Library) during the course. After the semester I started working on a C++ desktop application using Qt Creator -- [NumInt](https://github.com/JohnSell620/NumInt), which tests HPC-Library and evaluates triple integrals. That summer I also began my journey down the road of machine learning, and it's very exciting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my first data science project, I decided to scrape book reviews from the Goodreads website and do a sentiment classification on them basically to get an idea of how representative the rating of each book was of the true average sentiment of the people that wrote reviews. (The repository for that project is [here](https://github.com/JohnSell620/sentiment-analysis-goodreads-reviews).) I started learning Python in the beginning of 2017 with the [Python challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), but it wasn't until I started with machine learning projects that my Python skills jumped to the advanced level. And that illustrates one of the most obvious and common-sense notions about programming that all the mentors express but isn't so quickly grasped (at least for me): the best way to learn programming is to jump on projects that interest you and don't stop working on them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of my career, I have over two years of solid programming experience, I've contributed to open source software, I'm still completing my master's degree, and I'm ready to start my first "official" role as a software engineer. I looking for the right company where I can work on things that are interesting and challenging and where my career can progress. I'll come back with updates on how things went.
